# Tools & Techniques

### Making Code Changes

[PayloadsAllTheThings/Active Directory Attack.md at master Â· swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Active%20Directory%20Attack.md)

### Reviewing Code

- If the change is substantial and user-facing, pull down the branch.
- Test for cases (particularly edge cases) that the PR author may have missed.

### QA

- Look at the list of items going out for release the next day.
- Go down the list one-by-one and thoroughly test changes.
