# I am become n00b, creator of Hello Worlds

## 
After a decade of working in IT, it always amazes me how much more there is to learn. If you are just starting out or relatively fresh to the industry, then my insight to you is this:

  `complacency is the harbinger of stagnation

**Complacency** is the death of curiousity and aspiration, any desire to learn new skills is abondoned. One can become too comfortable when occupying a role. This is especially true as [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)  is rampant among us. If one manages to finally overcome it, then it would be natural to nest into the role that has finally been mastered. After all, confidence in your ability makes your comfortable, right?


## The Forever Student   
There is nothing wrong with being complacent in some roles/fields in IT that are niche. However, if you are looking at getting into security this is simply not viable. You MUST be an active learner to succeed.
