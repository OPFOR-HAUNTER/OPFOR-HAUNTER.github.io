A ninja of the digital shadows

## I am become n00b, creator of HelloWorlds

After a decade of working in IT, it always amazes me how much more there is to learn...and how many times I’ve had to start from complete scratch. My journey so far has included the following (in order of employment opportunity):

- Frontend web dev intern learning HTML/CSS...without pay
- QA for programmed surveys and a project manager
- PHP developer and Linux admin (learned a lot here, but I was in over my head)
- Tier 1-3 helpdesk and eventually promoted to network/systems analyst. This provided the largest variety of experience for me among most IT domains.
    - at this time I studied for a cyber security B.S. and several security certifications (CCSP, SSCP, Sec+, Net+, etc.)
- Finally I broke into the security vertical, currently still enjoying my team in a SOC as a DFIR specialist.
    - I also earned my M.S. in cyber security at this time, including certs like CEH/CHFI.

Imposter syndrome is implied at each bullet point fyi.

## Why the actual hell would I do this?

### Getting my foot in the door, of course.

This was due to the fact I did not have a degree initially. However, I always knew I would never settle for anything less than my dream job ideals. The security vertical itself is rarely considered an overall entry-level IT vertical, requiring experience elsewhere typically (even with a degree).

### Switching from Blue Team to Red Team

Now that I have been a blue teamer for 3 years now, I feel ready to pivot. I am optimistic my varied experience will assist me become a competent red team operator. Or possibly an incompetent one that is ruggedly handsome. 

#Time will tell.#

## Opposing Force (OpFor)

“[An **opposing force** (alternatively **enemy force**, abbreviated **OPFOR**) is a military unit tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in war game scenarios.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposing_force)”

I'll be covering various red team concepts, scripts, tools, etc. Blue team stuff will also be touched on, as well as CTF writeups and other related things. 

I believe that if you can explain a concept to someone else, then you have cemented that knowledge and understand it. Maybe I can also share something that can help others move forward, too. In any case, this blog is a tool I’ll be using for self-accountability toward my goal, and help retain the vast amount of stuff in my smooth brain.

Thanks for reading.
