# The Road to Offensive Apotheosis

> tl;dr: I’ve had a very diverse IT career, and I am now throwing the gauntlet down to pursue my goal to become ~~the hokage~~ a red team professional.

## Where does Opposing Force (OPFOR) come from?

“[An **opposing force** (alternatively **enemy force**, abbreviated **OPFOR**) is a military unit tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in war game scenarios.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposing_force)”

Seems pretty on-the-nose for a red team oriented blog, right?

I'll be covering various red team concepts, scripts, tools, etc. Blue team stuff will also be touched on, as well as CTF writeups and other related things. 

I believe that if you can explain a concept to someone else, then you have cemented that knowledge and understand it. Maybe I can also share something that can help others move forward, too. In any case, this blog is a tool I’ll be using for self-accountability toward my goal, and help retain the vast amount of stuff in my smooth brain.

## I am become n00b, creator of HelloWorlds
### Who am I?

I am an infosec specialist and a forever student.

After a decade of working in IT, it always amazes me how much more there is to learn...and how many times I’ve had to start from complete scratch. My journey so far has included the following in order of employment opportunity:

- Frontend web dev intern learning HTML/CSS...without pay
- QA for programmed surveys and a project manager
- PHP developer and Linux admin (learned a lot here, but I was in over my head)
- Tier 1-3 helpdesk and eventually promoted to network/systems analyst. This provided the largest variety of experience for me among most IT domains.
    - at this time I studied for a cyber security B.S. and several security certifications (CCSP, SSCP, Sec+, Net+, etc.)
- Finally I broke into the security vertical, currently still enjoying my team in a SOC as a DFIR specialist.
    - I also earned my M.S. in cyber security at this time, including certs like CEH/CHFI.

Imposter syndrome is implied at each bullet point fyi. It was VERY challenging, but I was able to build off each experience to pivot each time closer to my goal. 

Now that I have been a blue teamer for 3 years now, I feel ready to pivot. I am optimistic my varied experience will assist me become a competent red team operator. Or possibly an incompetent one that is ruggedly handsome. 

*Time will tell.*

Wrex said it himself:

> Naturally, anything that isn’t constantly challenged grows weak.

So let's challenge ourselves!
