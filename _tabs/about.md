<h3>I am a security engineer and an aspiring penetration tester.</h3>
<p>It is the intent of this blog to both educate others on their own
   journies, as well as hopefully forcing me to stay on track... </p>
<p>In theory, I <strong>should</strong> be covering various red team
   concepts such as OSINT, scripts, tools, etc. Blue team stuff will be
   touched on, and hopefully guides to CTFs and other related things.</p>
