<h3>I am a security engineer and an aspiring red team operator.</h3>
<p>It is the intent of this blog to both educate others on their own
   journies, as well as hopefully forcing myself to stay on track... </p>
<p>I'll be covering various red team concepts, scripts, tools, etc. Blue team stuff will also be touched on, as well as CTF writeups and other related things.</p>
